## **FAQ:**

**Q:** Why are you using json files instead of a database?<br>
**A:** I'm using json files because it's easier to manage and I don't need to worry about setting up a database, I will set up a database when the bot is fully fleshed out

**Q:** When are you fixing your bot hosting?<br>
**A:** Just like the reason why I'm using json files, i am hosting from my ide for quicker testing, I will use a hosting service whe the bot is done
