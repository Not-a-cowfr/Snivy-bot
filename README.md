## **FAQ:**

#### **Q:** Why are you using json files instead of a database?
**A:** I'm using json files because it's easier to manage and I don't need to worry about setting up a database, I will set up a database when the bot is fully fleshed out<br><br>

#### **Q:** When are you fixing your bot hosting?
**A:** Just like the reason why I'm using json files, i am hosting from my ide for quicker testing, I will use a hosting service whe the bot is done<br><br>

#### **Q:** Why is some of this code so ass?
**A:** This is just a side project for me, i am currently the only maintainer so the most important thing to me, is to have the code work<br><br>
